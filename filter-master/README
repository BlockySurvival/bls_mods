# filter mod

This mod adds a simple chat filter. There is no default word list,
and adding words to the filter list is done through the `/filter`
chat command. You need the `server` priv to use the chat command.

The `/filter` chat command can `add`, `remove` or `list` words. The
words are stored in `mod_storage`, which means that this mod requires
0.4.16 or above to function.

If a player speaks a word that is listed in the filter list, they are
muted for 1 minute. After that, their `shout` privilege is restored.
If they leave, their `shout` privilege is still restored, but only after
the time expires, not before.

The filter words list is in words.txt
